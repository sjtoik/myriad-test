# A test how to use pyLMS7002Soapy library

You need to have the MyriadRF module from upstream:
https://github.com/myriadrf/pyLMS7002Soapy

```
git clone https://github.com/myriadrf/pyLMS7002Soapy
cd pyLMS7002Soapy
pipenv shell
python3 setup.py install
```

For SoapySDR, check https://github.com/pothosware/PothosCore/wiki/Ubuntu
or try your luck with https://github.com/sjtoik/vm-setup/blob/master/ubuntu_soapy.sh

SoapySDR and the Pothos project seems to be quite dead though.
